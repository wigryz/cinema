### Continuous integration

There is a control integration named CircleCI set up for this project. It tests all branches, so after your push
there will be a run going in the background. After some time you will notice a :heavy_check_mark: - if your
build was successful or :x: - if it failed. You can click on it to get more information about tests that failed or
some information about test coverage.

What does our CI do:
* build application,
* run unit & integration tests,
* printing out code coverage,
* validate formatting and imports.
